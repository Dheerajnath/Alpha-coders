1. Project Title

FairPrice Agri – Accessible Market Price Intelligence for Indian Farmers

2. Introduction

Agriculture remains the primary livelihood for a significant portion of India’s population. Despite producing essential food commodities, farmers often receive unfair compensation due to the absence of transparent and timely market price information. This lack of access creates an imbalance where intermediaries control pricing decisions, leading to systematic income loss for farmers.
FairPrice Agri proposes a technology-driven yet low-barrier solution that delivers verified market prices, weather alerts, and crop advisories directly to farmers through channels they already use, such as SMS and voice calls, thereby reducing dependency on intermediaries and enabling informed selling decisions.

3. Problem Statement

Indian farmers frequently sell their produce without knowledge of current mandi prices, Minimum Support Price (MSP), or demand conditions. Although official price data is published by government platforms, it is often inaccessible due to language limitations, complex interfaces, unreliable internet access, and low digital literacy. As a result, farmers are forced to accept undervalued offers, leading to repeated financial losses, increased debt, and economic distress.

4. Proposed Solution Overview

FairPrice Agri is an information dissemination platform designed to bridge the price knowledge gap between farmers and agricultural markets. The system aggregates real-time market price data from verified sources and delivers it in simplified, localized formats through SMS, voice-based systems, and lightweight web interfaces. The platform also provides weather alerts, crop advisories, and MSP awareness to support better planning and negotiation during crop sales.

5. Objectives

To provide farmers with real-time and reliable crop price information
To ensure accessibility for users with limited digital literacy
To minimize price exploitation by reducing information asymmetry
To increase awareness of MSP and government support mechanisms
To support timely decision-making through weather and advisory alerts
