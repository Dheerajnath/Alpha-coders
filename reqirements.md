1. Project Title

FairPrice Agri - Providing Built-in Information about Agri-Products, Prices, and Conditions throughout India 

 

2. Introduction

Around 60% of all working people in India are involved in agriculture, and although agricultural products are necessary for our daily lives, farmers often do not receive fair returns on their products because they do not receive accurate information about market prices and other related events on time. Farmers rely on third parties (known as intermediaries) to provide them with market price information; therefore, intermediaries can set the price for farmers and take a significant cut from their profits, leading to an ongoing loss of income to farmers.

FairPrice Agri has a low-cost, technology-based solution to solving the issue of farmers not knowing what the market price should be, what the current weather conditions are, and what crops they should be growing. FairPrice Agri uses communication channels such as SMS and VMs to inform farmers of up-to-date, verified market/mandi prices and to provide information about weather alerts and where they can buy the best product. This will reduce the number of times farmers have to rely on intermediaries for market price information and thus allow them to make informed decisions about how and when to sell their products.

3. Problem Statement

Indian farmers frequently sell their products without knowing what the relevant mandi, MSB, or demand conditions are for their products. Although there are government-sponsored price publications available for farmers to access, many farmers are unable to access these sites due to multiple reasons including language issues, complicated interfaces to access sites, unreliable internet connectivity, and agricultural workers' low literacy rate. Therefore many farmers must accept low bid prices from middlemen for their products, thus resulting in ongoing economic loss, debt, and economic distress for Indian farmers over time.

4. Description of Proposed Solution

FairPrice Agri has developed a platform for farmers to access pricing information to facilitate the selling of crops at fair market values. FairPrice Agri obtains “real-time” prices from trusted sources and provides them to the farmers in a simple format (i.e. SMS, voice, or a small web application). The farmers will be able to make better sales decisions with this real-time price information. In addition to providing pricing information, FairPrice Agri will also provide the farmers with alerts regarding weather conditions, crop advisory information, and MSP in order to assist them in planning for the selling of their products and negotiating better prices during the sale process.

5. Goals

Deliver accurate price data in real-time to the farmers.
Provide access to pricing data in a format that is easy for farmers to use and understand regardless of their ability to use the Internet or digital technology.
Reduce price manipulation caused by lack of access to current prices.
Improve farmer's understanding of the MSP and other forms of government assistance.
Provide timely decision support through alerts on weather and advisory data.

6. Primary Stakeholder Groups


| Stakeholder             | Description                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Farmers                 | Primary beneficiaries and end users              |
| Government Agencies     | Providers of mandi prices, MSP, and weather data |
| Agricultural Experts    | Contributors of crop and pest advisories         |
| Platform Administrators | Responsible for system operation and monitoring  |
| NGOs & Cooperatives     | Assist in farmer onboarding and outreach         |

7. Farmer User :

Has access to a simple mobile device or entry-level smartphone.
Will not have experience with using digital applications.
Will need to receive information in the language spoken in their geographic region.
Has a short time to make selling decisions about their crops.

8. Administrator User :

Is knowledgeable about the technical or subject area of the data sources.
Will be responsible for monitoring the current and historical operating state of the data sources and the systems supporting them.
Is responsible for administering the user access rights, as well as the system configuration.

9. Functional Requirements

The system must allow farmers to register using a mobile number and basic profile information.

The system will enable farmers to select one or more types of crops to obtain information about.

The system will collect mandi price data on a periodic basis from a single, authorized and verified source.

The system will use SMS and voice messages to notify farmers of the current market price for their selected crops.

All information presented by the system to farmers will be in their preferred regional language.

Subject to geographic proximity, mandis with the lowest market prices will be prioritized for display by the system.

The system will compare market prices against the minimum support price (MSP) for farmers, and provide notification if any prices fall below that threshold.

The system will provide weather alerts to farmers based on the location of their farm.

The system will provide expert-verified crop advisory information in relation to pest control, harvesting and storage of the farmer's crops.

The system will allow farmers to request price information via SMS or voice message.

The system will provide administrators with an administrative dashboard from which they can manage data sources and monitor the overall status of the system.

10. Non-Functional Requirements
NFR-1: Accessibility
The application must work correctly on basic mobile devices and must not require Internet access. 

NFR-2: Scalability
The application must be scalable, meaning it should be able to support large amounts of users from different locations and over various crop growing seasons.

NFR-3: Availability
The application must be designed to provide high levels of availability (99.99%) during peak planting/harvest periods.

NFR-4: Data Integrity
The application must use only information from the verified data providers and disseminate that information.

NFR-5: Security
The application must ensure that user data is treated securely and that unauthorized third-parties cannot access this data.

NFR-6: Performance
The application must provide responses and alerts to users in a timely manner.

11. Assumptions
There are mobile devices available to all farmers.
Government agricultural data will be published on a daily basis.
The telecom infrastructure exist to facilitate the sending/receiving of SMS and voice communications in rural areas.
There will be multilingual translation services at the district level for the regional languages of India.

12. Constraints
The amount of agricultural data available to farmers will vary from location to location.
External government data sources will be relied upon to provide the farming community with agricultural data.
There is large diversity in the languages spoken across India.
Farmers are generally not aware of the application prior to the initial rollout.

12. Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                   | Mitigation                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Data delays            | Use multiple data sources and validation |
| Low adoption           | Partner with local cooperatives and NGOs |
| Language inaccuracies  | Human-reviewed translations              |
| Infrastructure outages | Redundant service providers              |


13. Performance Measures

Decrease in the price difference between the offered vs what is current in the Mandi
Increase in participation from farmers
Increased average income for farmers each season
Rate of adoption of the solution in various geographic areas and types of crops

14. Future Possibilities

Predictive pricing using Artificial Intelligence
Providing integration with digital payment systems
Providing support (and access) for crop insurance and claims support
Providing a marketplace directly connecting farmers to buyers

15. Summary

FairPrice Agri will develop an open and transparent agricultural information system. FairPrice Agri will provide farmers with access to reliable information to empower them to make proper market-based decisions; it will also reduce farmers' exposure to economic exploitation and assist with the long-term financial stability of rural economies.
